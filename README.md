# ðŸ”˜ Button LED Control System â€“ Task 1

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a basic control system using an Arduino Uno board.  
Three push buttons are used to control three LEDs (orange, blue, and green).  
Each button is mapped to a specific LED: when the button is pressed, the corresponding LED turns ON.

This task aims to demonstrate fundamental embedded systems concepts: inputs, processing, and outputs.
